- `merge conflict`: Merge conflicts in Git occur when two different branches have made changes to the same part of a file, and Git doesn't know which changes to keep.
- NOT RECOMMENDED : `Overwriting Git history` means making changes to commits that have already been pushed to a shared repository. This could include modifying commit messages, removing or adding commits, or even reordering commits in the history. It's done using commands like git commit --amend, git rebase, or git filter-branch.
